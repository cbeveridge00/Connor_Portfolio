# Adversarial Search - Checkers Bot

This project was built on top of a standard python checkers application. The code was extended to incorporate these AI algorithms allowing students to play against their bots and test them against a random bot. Adversarial search involves competitive environments in which agents are acting in their best interest and expecting their opponents to do the same. This particular instance is a two-player zero-sum game.

This includes the full solutions to the project. Full student README can be found in the project folder which includes instructions on how to run the code.

### Educational Goals

This project aims to strengthen student skills in python and test algorithm understanding through implementation of the MiniMax and AlphaBeta Algorithms
