# Connor Beveridge's Python/AI/ML Portfolio

Connor Beveridge's Portfolio of AI/ML Academic, Personal, and Professional Projects in Python

### In This Portfolio, you will find select projects I have built and/or completed during my time as a student (Masters in Computer Science, Udacity Nanodegree programs), as an Instructor at Wayne Community College, and for personal interest.

# Python Projects Built for Community College Courses (Solutions Included)

These projects are done in python and are mostly coded from scratch, no major packages are used other than common ones like numpy

| Project Link | Project Description |
|---|---|
| [Optimization algorithms - Backpack Problem](https://github.com/cbeveridge00/Connor_Portfolio/tree/main/backpack) | Students code the Genetic, Simulated Annealing, and Hill Climbing optimization algorithms to solve the backpack problem. Determine which items you should add to a backpack maximize the total value of the items without surpassing backpack capacity. |
| [Adversarial Search - Checkersbot]((https://github.com/cbeveridge00/Connor_Portfolio/tree/main/Checkers%20Bot) | Students code the MiniMax and Alpha-beta adversarial search algorithms to produce a checkers bot. |
