# Connor's Python/AI/ML Portfolio

Connor Beveridge's Portfolio of AI/ML Academic, Personal, and Professional Projects in Python

### In This Portfolio, you will find select projects I have built and/or completed during my time as a student (Masters in Computer Science, Udacity Nanodegree programs), as an Instructor at Wayne Community College, and for personal interest.

## Python Project and Assignment Examples Built for Community College Courses (Solutions Included)

These projects are done in python and are mostly coded from scratch, no major packages are used other than common ones like numpy

| Project Link | Project Description |
|---|---|
| [Optimization algorithms - Backpack Problem](https://github.com/cbeveridge00/Connor_Portfolio/tree/main/backpack) | Students code the Genetic, Simulated Annealing, and Hill Climbing optimization algorithms to solve the backpack problem. Determine which items you should add to a backpack maximize the total value of the items without surpassing backpack capacity. |
| [Adversarial Search - Checkersbot](https://github.com/cbeveridge00/Connor_Portfolio/tree/main/Checkers%20Bot) | Students code the MiniMax and Alpha-beta adversarial search algorithms to produce a checkers bot. |
| [Constraint Satisfaction Search - Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/cbeveridge00/Connor_Portfolio/tree/main/Sudoku_Solver) | Students code the Backtracking search algorithm to produce a Sudoku Solver. |
| [Deep Learning Utilization - Waitroom Person Tracker App](https://github.com/cbeveridge00/Connor_Portfolio/tree/main/Person%20Tracker) | Students utilize pre-trained models in an app for person tracking for waitroom monitoring. |

## Industry Projects
| Project Link | Project Description |
|---|---|
| [Tool tracing application for foam etching](https://github.com/cbeveridge00/Connor_Portfolio/tree/main/ToolApp) | Built for a foam etching company for users to capture vectorized tool tracings at home so tools would not need to be brought into the shop. |

## Personal Interest Projects

| Project Link | Project Description |
|---|---|
| [Bayes Net Modeling and Inference](https://github.com/cbeveridge00/Connor_Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Bayesian_Network.ipynb) | Built as an example of Bayes Net construction and inference for reference |
| [CNN model Improvement](https://github.com/cbeveridge00/Connor_Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/CNN_extended.ipynb) | A basic CNN model is compared to one that is significantly strengthed with batch normalization, dropout, and more. |
