# Backtracking Search - Constraint Satisfaction - Sudoku Solver

This project was built on top of a suduko puzzle app. The code was extended to allow students to automate the solving of the puzzle with the backtracking search algorithm. The backtracking search algorithm fills in the puzzle according to the constraints or rules of sudoku until the current assignments are found to not fit the constraints. When this lack of acceptable assignment occurs, the algorithm backtracks through its current assignment until it can continue with an assignment that follows the rules. This continues until the puzzle is complete and it will solve any sudoku puzzle.
