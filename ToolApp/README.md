# Tool Tracing App in Python with OpenCV

This is a freelance python project for a foam etching company, a tool tracer application for customer use. This application is built for Raspberry pi (Linux) and is shipped along with the camera setup for customers to trace their tools at home, where normally they would need to be brought in. This utilizes vectorization and computer vision techniques (OpenCV - morphological operations) to extract an optimal vectorized tool tracing which is sent online to the company for product production. 

This tkinter app starts up automatically on starting the pi and allows one to connect to the internet in the app.
