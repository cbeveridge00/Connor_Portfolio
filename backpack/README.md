# Optimization - Backpack problem

This is a project I built from scratch on local search in complex environments. Local search algorithms search from a start state to neighboring states. The goal here is optimization, aiming to find a best state according to some objective function. The objective function in this case is according to the backpack or knapsack problem: "Given a set of different items, each one with an associated value and weight, determine which items you should pick in order to maximize the value of the items in the backpack without surpassing it's capacity.
